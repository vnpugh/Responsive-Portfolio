        <p> Greetings! My name is Velvet Pugh and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. Prior to
            making a career change into web development, I worked as an auditor and International Tax Accountant
            with various companies, including KPMG, Citibank and Catholic Health Initiatives. In addition, I graduated
            from Florida State University with a double major in accounting and labor economics. I am also a local
            member of Women Who Code, She’s Coding and a volunteer for Dallas Independent School District. Also, I am
            originally from Tampa, FL, but I’ve lived across the U.S. including Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago, Denver
            and now Dallas, TX. </p><br>
        <p>When I am not spending time with my family or working, I love to travel, attend music
            events and take weekend road trips. One of the perks of growing up in Florida is that it is easy to travel
            to the Caribbean Islands by ferry or plane. One of favorite islands to visit with my family is the Bahamas.
            During the holidays, we travel by ferry from Fort Lauderdale to Nassau to enjoy good music and endless
            amounts
            of rum. Overall, I am excited about working as a web developer and improving my skill set in HTML, CSS,
            Java,
            JavaScript and MySQL. Additionally, I am looking forward to learning Angular and other tech skills in the
            future including Python, Node.js, jQuery, React and MongoDB.</p>
